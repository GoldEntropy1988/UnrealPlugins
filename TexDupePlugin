# TexDupe - Texture Duplicate Finder

A high-performance Unreal Engine plugin for finding duplicate textures in your project.

## Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Detection**: Compares every pixel to ensure 100% accuracy
- **Fast Scanning**: Optimized hash-based algorithm with lazy evaluation
- **Settings Comparison**: Optional texture settings matching (compression, format, etc.)
- **Visual Grouping**: Color-coded groups for easy identification
- **Auto-Scan**: Automatically scans all project textures when none selected

## Usage

1. Open the TexDupe window from the editor
2. (Optional) Select textures in Content Browser to scan specific assets
3. Click **Refresh** to start scanning
4. Review duplicate groups in the results list
5. Click any texture to locate it in Content Browser

## UI Elements

- **Refresh**: Start duplicate scan
- **Clear**: Clear results list
- **Match Settings**: Enable to only find duplicates with identical texture settings
- **Search**: Filter results by texture name

## Result Columns

- **Group**: Duplicate group number
- **Name**: Texture asset name (color-coded by group)
- **Path**: Full asset path
- **Refs**: Number of references to this texture
- **Size**: Texture dimensions (WIDTHxHEIGHT)

## How It Works

1. **Quick Filter**: Groups textures by size and file size
2. **Sample Check**: Compares 36 sample points for potential duplicates
3. **Pixel Verification**: Full pixel-by-pixel comparison for accuracy
4. **Settings Check**: (Optional) Compares texture import settings

## What This Tool Does

TexDupe performs **pixel-by-pixel image analysis** to find exact duplicates. Unlike hash-based tools, it guarantees 100% accuracy by comparing every pixel in the texture. This ensures you only see true duplicates, not just similar-looking textures.

## Why Use TexDupe

Large projects often contain duplicated textures due to:
- Multiple team members importing the same assets
- Marketplace pack overlaps
- Outsourced asset delivery
- Manual copy operations

TexDupe helps you quickly identify and clean them up before shipping, reducing memory waste and improving asset organization.

## Performance

- Skips non-texture assets automatically
- Only loads textures when needed
- Progress bars show real-time status
- Cancellable at any time

## Notes

- Textures must have dimensions divisible by 4
- Only finds exact pixel matches (not similar images)
- Settings comparison includes: compression, mip settings, LOD group, SRGB, filter mode, address mode, max size
- Editor-only — no runtime overhead
